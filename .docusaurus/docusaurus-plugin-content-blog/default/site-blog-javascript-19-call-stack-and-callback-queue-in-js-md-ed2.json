  "description": "JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it can only perform one task at a time. However, it is capable of handling multiple tasks simultaneously using the concept of Call Stack. The Call Stack is a mechanism used by the JavaScript engine to keep track of function calls. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the Call Stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the stack.",
