# Introduction to JS

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and for good reason. It is a powerful language that can be used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. In this blog post, we will take an overview of complete language

## History

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in May 1995, while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was originally called Mocha, but was later renamed to LiveScript and finally JavaScript. The language was created to add interactivity to static HTML pages, which was a revolutionary concept at the time.

In 1996, Microsoft created JScript, which was essentially a clone of JavaScript. This led to a period of intense competition between Netscape and Microsoft, with both companies adding new features to their respective languages. This competition ultimately led to the creation of ECMAScript, which is a standardized version of JavaScript that is maintained by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA).

Over the years, JavaScript has continued to evolve, with new features and capabilities being added to the language. Today, JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language that can be used for both client-side and server-side programming. It is a critical component of modern web development, and is used by developers all over the world to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

## JS Compilation Steps

The process of converting JavaScript source code into bytecode involves several steps. Firstly, the JavaScript engine parses the source code and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the structure of the code. Next, the engine compiles the AST into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code that can be executed by the engine. The bytecode is then optimized by the engine using various techniques, such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, to improve the performance of the code. Finally, the engine executes the bytecode.

## JavaScript Engine

JavaScript Engine is a program that executes JavaScript code. It is responsible for interpreting and compiling the code, as well as optimizing its performance. The most popular JavaScript engines include V8, which is used in Google Chrome and Node.js, and SpiderMonkey, which is used in Mozilla Firefox.

## ES6 vs Common JS

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 6, is a newer version of JavaScript that was released in 2015. It introduced several new features to the language, such as arrow functions, template literals, and classes, that make writing code in JavaScript much easier and more efficient. Common JS, on the other hand, is a module system for JavaScript that was developed for use in server-side environments.

While ES6 is a newer and more modern version of JavaScript, Common JS is still widely used in server-side development. Node.js, a popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment, uses Common JS modules by default. However, many developers are shifting towards using ES6 modules for server-side development as well.

Regardless of which version is used, JavaScript remains an incredibly versatile and powerful language. Its ability to be used for both client-side and server-side development, as well as its popularity within the developer community, make it an important language to learn for anyone interested in programming or web development.

## Uses

JavaScript can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, server-side programming, and even desktop and mobile application development. It is also commonly used in game development, data visualization, and other areas where interactivity is important. With its versatility and popularity, JavaScript is a language that is well worth learning for anyone interested in programming or web development.
